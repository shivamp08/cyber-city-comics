Full Stack web application that displays and navigates through xkcd web comic strips.

## Motivation

To showcase my full-stack web development skills, via the MERN stack.

## Features

- **Navigation Buttons**: buttons to navigate to the previous and next comic strip.
- **Comic Display**: one comic strip displayed per page.
- **Comic Info**: information like date created, view count, and number are all displayed on top of the comic.
- **Navigation Field**: navigate to a specific comic strip by including a comic # in the URL ("https://cyber-cty-comics.herokuapp.com/614") or by using the search bar in the corner.
